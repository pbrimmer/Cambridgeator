### Description of the Oscillator:
The Cambridgeator, which is really just the Brusselator set up to compare with the Iodine clock experiment, follows these reactions:

$$
\begin{align}
{\rm A} &\rightarrow {\rm X} & k_1 \\
{\rm 2X + Y} &\rightarrow {\rm 3X} & k_2 \\
{\rm X + B} &\rightarrow {\rm Y + D} & k_3\\
{\rm X} &\rightarrow {\rm E} & k_4
\end{align}
$$

**Student Question: What is the overall reaction?**  
Holding the concentrations [A], [B], [D] and [E] constant, the concentrations [X] and [Y] change according to the rate equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d[{\rm X}]}{dt} &= k_1 [{\rm A}] + k_2 [{\rm Y}] [{\rm X}]^2 - k_3 [{\rm B}] [{\rm X}]  - k_4 [{\rm X}], \\
\frac{d[{\rm Y}]}{dt} &= k_3 [{\rm B}] [{\rm X}] - k_2 [{\rm X}]^2 [{\rm Y}], \\
\end{align}
$$
